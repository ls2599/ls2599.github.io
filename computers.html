   <div class="c2"> <p1> General notes for all devices: <ul>
				<li> Determine the power state of the device by listening for sounds such as a fan or looking
					for flashing lights</li>
				<li> If the device is off, do not turn it on.</li>
				<li> Do not use the device.</li>
				<li> Photograph the device, other componants and its surroundings including the screen if on.</li>
	  </ul></p1></div>

		<p1><ol>
		<li>Uniquely label (but do not remove) the power cable and all other cables, wires or USB drives
			attached to the computer as well as the corresponding connection each cable, wire or USB drive
			is connected to on the computer. Photograph once labelled.</li><br>
		<li>Remove the power cable from the back of the computer and from the wall outlet, power
			extention socket or other external power supply. Secure in the evidence bag and label.</li><br>
		<li>Indvidually disconnect all other cables, wires and USB devices from the computer noting down the
			device or equipment connected to the cable.</li><br>		
		<li><strong>Open and close the CD/DVD tray. Note whether these drive trays are empty, contain disks, or
			are unchecked; and tape the drive slot closed to prevent it from opening. Note: If no tower is present
			the slot may be on the back or side of the screen</strong></li><br>
		<li>Place tape over the power button on the screen and tower if present.</li><br>
		<li>Package the screen, tower and any other devices in evidence bags or boxes. This prevents damage or
			alteration during transportation and storage. </li><br>
		<li>Note the make, model, serial numbers and any user-applied markings or identifiers to the devices on
			evidence bag or logs.</li>
    </ol> </p1> </div>
	
	<div class="c4"><a name="on"><p1>Section 1b - Computer powered ON: </p1></a><p1><ul>
		 <li>Removing the power supply when seizing a computer is, generally, the safest option. However, if
			 evidence of a crime is visible on the computer display power should be maintained and assistance from
			 someone with live data capture and preservation experience should be found to capture the current
			 state of the device.</li><br>
		 <li>If information or activity on the screen suggests that data is being deleted or overwritten, it is
			 suggested that the power supply is removed from the device immediatly.</li></ul> <br>
		 	
			 Be aware of the crime scene environment and look out for pieces of paper with possible passwords or
			 handwritten notes, blank pads of paper with impressions from prior writings, hardware and software
			 manuals and information documents or graphic material printed from the computer that may reveal
			 information relevant to the investigation.</p1></div>
	
	<div class="c5"><a name="comp_evidence"><p1>Section 1c - Potential evidence from a Computer<br></p1></a>
		<p1>The hardware and software can both provide cruital evidence to an investigation. Documents, photos, e-
			mails and attachments, databases, financial information, Internet browsing history (including chat
			logs), software event logs, data stored on external devices and identifying information associated
			with the computer system and components are all potential evidence which could prove the investigation
			either way.
		</p1> </div>
	
	<div class="c6"><a name="ext_device"><p1>Section 2a - External Devices <br></p1></a> 
		<p1>External devices are items that can be connected to a computer to enhance a users experience whether
			to make an action easier or to add additional funtions to the computer. External devices is items such
			as a keyboard or mouse and also includes external webcams, microphones or storage device readers (for
			memory cards or CD/DVDs).
		</p1></div>
	
	<div class="c7"> <a name="ext_dev_evidence"><p1>Section 2b - Potential Evidence from an External
		Device<br></p1></a> 
		<p1>These external devices have no storage capacity therefore these devices are not required to be seized
			for a digital investigation. However, they would provide fingerprints or DNA evidence so may be
			required for a forensic science investgation. This also applies for webcams and microphones.
			Providing the storage device reader is empty this also applies to those devices however if there is a
			memory card or disk in the device these items should be seized with the reader seperate to the device
			it was connected to.

	<div class="c8"><p1><a name="networked">Section 3a - Networked / Business Systems</a><br>
 			Networked Systems have many uses including file sharing within a company, allowing remote access to
			the system and making resources such as software packages available to be shared between multiple
			users.<br>
			
			Networked systems should be secured until a digital forensic specialist is available to correctly
			handle the system. Nobody should use or touch the device as handling a networked system is complicated
			and any wrong actions taken could destroy data from a legitimate business or damage the system.
		</p1></div>
	
	<div class="c9"><p1><a name="networked_evidence">Section 3b - Potential Evidence from a Networked / Business
			System</a><br>
			The wide uses a networked system provides means there is a lot of information which could be useful in
			an investigation. This includes files, images and information databases as well as physical forensic
			evidence such as fingerprints and DNA
