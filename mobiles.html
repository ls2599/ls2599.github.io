  <div class="md2"><p1> General notes for all devices: <ul> 
	  				<li> Photograph the device and its surroundings including the screen.</li>
	  				<li> Collect all cables for the device</li>
	  			</ul><br>
	  				Mobile devices are found in many different sizes, colours and brands however are all important for an investigation.
	  </p1></div>
	  
  <div class="md3"><p1>Section 1a - Mobile Device is OFF:<br> <ul>
	  <li> Do not power the device on. Look for any SIM card or memory card slots. If either or both a SIM and
		  memory card is found, remove it and secure in an evidence bag and label. This prevents contact with the cellular network on a Global System for Mobile (GSM).</li>
	  <li> If possible, remove the battery.</li>
	  <li> The device should be stored in a Faraday bag to block connectivity to cellular, Wi-Fi, GPS,
		  Bluetooth or other wireless signals until the device processing starts. </li>
	  </ul></p1></div>
	  
  <div class="md4"><p1>Section 1b - Mobile Device is ON: <br> <ul>
	  <li>Locate and remove any SIM cards or memory cards and place the device in “Airplane” mode (usually found
		  in “Settings”). If possible the battery should also be removed but maintained as well as charging
		  cables.</li>
	  <li>If the device has an Apple iOS operating system (iPhone, iPad, etc.) and the screen is locked with a
		  passcode, you should be able to place it in Airplane mode by swiping vertically from either the top
		  right corner of the screen or the bottom of the screen (iOS version dependant) and selecting the icon of
		  an airplane. The passcode should be noted. The process of enabling Airplane Mode is the same if unlocked
	  	  for an iOS device.</li>
	  <li>If the device has an Android operating system (Google, Samsung, HTC and many more) and locked with a
		  passcode or pattern it can be placed in Airplane mode even with a passcode or pattern lock enabled by
		  holding down the power button and then selecting Airplane mode when asked. If the Android device is
		  unlocked, you can usually find Airplane Mode under Settings. Any passcodes (some apps may have seperate
		  passcodes) or pattern lock should be noted.</li>
	  <li>Once the above suggestions are followed, power down the device and remove the battery if possible. The
		  battery should still be removed from a powered down device to prevent a preset alarm from powering on
		  the device.</li>
	  <li>The device shuld then be stored in a Radio Frequency (RF) shielded enclosure (such as a Faraday bag) or
		  or if the device is too big a Ramsey Shielded Enclosure should be used to block connectivity to
		  cellular, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth or other wireless signals.</li>
	  </ul></p1></div>
	
	<div class="md5"><p1> Section 1c - Potential Evidence from a Mobile Device <br>
		Mobile phones (burner phones) may contain information such as text or call logs and photographs. Smart
		phone devices will contain this information in addition to software application data, documents, Internet
		browsing history (including internet chat logs and buddy lists), databases and financial records which
		could all be valuable evidence in an investigation.
